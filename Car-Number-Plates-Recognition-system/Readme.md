Overview

This project is aimed at developing a system for recognizing and extracting car number plates from images or videos using [mention any specific technologies or libraries used, e.g., OpenCV, EasyOCR, Flask, etc.].

## Features

- **Number Plate Detection**: Detection of car number plates within images or video frames.
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Extracting alphanumeric characters from the detected number plates.
- **Database Integration**: Saving recognized number plates and associated data to a database (if applicable).
- **Web Interface (Optional)**: Providing a user interface to interact with the recognition system (e.g., upload images/videos, view recognized plates).
